# *bedrockpy* Examples

The examples in this directory either serve as showing how this library
may be used or have been created in order to test things during
development.

Each example will start the server on `$IP:6464` or `localhost:6464` if
`$IP` is not an environment variable. Logging is enabled in each
example.
