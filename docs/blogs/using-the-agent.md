The agent is used in the "Education Edition" of Minecraft with the intention to teach students
how to code.

1. Turn on "Education Edition" in section "Cheats" when creating or editing a world.
2. Establish a connection to a websocket connection by using the `connect` command.
3. Type `agent create` in the chat.
