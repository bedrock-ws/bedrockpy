# Setup

## Configure settings in the game

```{video} _static/settings.mp4
---
alt: Settings → General → Require Encrypted Websockets → Disable
autoplay: true
loop: true
muted: true
---
```

Settings → General → Require Encrypted Websockets → Disable


## Testing

Instead of writing multiple lines of code in order just to test if
everything is set up correctly, *bedrockpy* provides a simple script
we can run.

```console
python -m bedrock._demo
```

Follow the instructions shown on the terminal.
